### Hey coder peeps, I'm Codemad! 👋

👩🏻‍💻 I'm a web developer with a lot of interest in Javascript. 

📹 I'm building a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxz9dj9cLxdcCS5ttfRHt9Q?view_as=subscriber) where I talk about code that I write, web performance topics, open source projects I'm interested in, concepts that are difficult to explain and in general talking about things I'm excited about! I publish all related code on github.
